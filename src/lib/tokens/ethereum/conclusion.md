Ethereum serves clear utility purposes as a computing platform and transaction settlement layer. While some applications built on Ethereum may be problematic from a Shariah perspective, the base protocol and its native token ETH represent legitimate technological infrastructure with real utility.

The primary concerns from an Islamic perspective would be:

1. Ensuring one's usage of ETH avoids participating in prohibited activities (gambling, interest-based lending, etc.)
2. Understanding that staking ETH is permissible as it represents validation services rather than interest-bearing loans

Based on our analysis, ETH itself serves legitimate purposes and its core functions do not violate Islamic principles.

Note: While we find this token comfortable to invest in from a halal perspective, this doesn't imply we think it is a strong investment.
